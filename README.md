# Lock-the-vote--Blockchain

E-voting is an electronic means for casting and counting votes. There are many advantages of e-voting, one of the most important is decreasing organization cost and increasing number of voters. But there is one threat with his system which is a single change can lead to large scale manipulation of votes. Combining this e-voting with the blockchain technology can be very advantageous here. It will lead to a very cost effective, transparent, reliable and real-time system for voting.

In this project, I have used MySQL database to store data.

<br/>

To demonstrate this system, I used a python library Flask and created some API with different methods(GET, POST) and tested those APIs using POSTMAN API platform.

For Execution: <br/>
Step 1: Run code on local server. <br/>
Step 2: Open postman app,  put server along with port as http://127.0.0.1:5000 <br/>
To use API, put methods after server as http://127.0.0.1:5000/{method_name} and set the respective method type(GET, POST) <br/>
<br/>
For POST method: <br/>
Give input as JSON . For example: <br/>
{"voters" : "A" , "candidates" : "Z"}
